Step | What to Build | Why
1 | TCP server and TCP client in C | Basic communication
2 | Define simple command protocol | Clean communication
3 | Server: handle LIST/READ/WRITE in shared folder | Real "shared folder"
4 | Client: CLI to list/read/write remotely | Usable minimal system
5 | (Later) Build a FUSE client | Full local mount support
